# nuxt-cli-test

> Basic login using Nuxt and Firebase

To configure Firebase credentials go to plugins > firebase.js and enter info from Firebase web interface.

This project is largely based on https://github.com/aofdev/vue-firebase-auth-vuex
If you would like to add logins for Twitter, Github, and Facebook, you can copy the code from the store, and login components.
I have deleted those to reduce clutter and make the project easier to understand.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production and launch server
